<p id="description">
  This Inventory Management System is a simple PHP OOP application built for
  training purposes. It includes user authentication with various methods such
  as try-catch blocks sanitization regex filtering and trimming. The core of the
  application revolves around the Product class which is designed with error
  handling using try-catch blocks and filtering mechanisms. The application
  utilizes PDO as the database driver for secure and efficient database
  operations. The folder structure is organized into controllers views assets
  and utilities facilitating future development and maintenance.
